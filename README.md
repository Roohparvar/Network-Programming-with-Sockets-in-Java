# Network Programming with Sockets in Java

## Project Overview
This project consists of two main components:
1. **Server**: Acts as the central point of communication in the network.
2. **Clients**: Connect to the server and can send or receive data through it.

### Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a network environment where multiple clients can connect to the server over a network and interact with it. Communication between the client and server is established through **sockets**, which are composed of an **IP address** and a **port number**.

### Project Components
The project is divided into two parts:
- **SERVER Project**: Contains the server-side code.
- **Client Project**: Will contain the client-side code.

### Project Status
- The server code is complete and has been added to the project.
- The client code is under development and will be added soon.

### How It Works
Once the client has the server's IP address and port number, it can connect to the server and establish communication through a socket.

### Additional Objective
Apart from establishing client-server communication, this project is also aimed at practicing network programming concepts and gaining familiarity with server and networking principles.

Stay tuned for the addition of the client code, which will be included in future updates. Please follow this project for updates.
